        I mainly know C++11, although I'm learning newer versions of the language (C++14 and above).
        
        I've read the C++ creator's book (The C++ Programming Language, 4th Ed. by Bjarne Stroustrup) to learn the design decisions behind the language and its features.
        I've applied this knowledge to the project I made for my bachelor's thesis, which is a ray tracing renderer. You can find it in my [portfolio](/portfolio).
        
        I've also read the Gang of Four book (Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) and thus I know how to imlpement common software engineering patterns in this language.

        Among other features, I know:
          * The STL library and containers
          * Generics
          * Template metaprogramming
          * Threads and futures
          * Lambda functions

        I have used this language mainly with Unity.
        Apart from using it at university in a project I also used it in my internship as a game developer as we used Unity to develop games.

        My main source of knowledge has been the great documentation available at [Microsoft's site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/).

        I know advanced features such as:
          * Properties
          * Events
          * Delegate methods
          * Coroutines
          * Attributes
          * Lambda expressions
          * Generics
          * Linq

        I use this language mainly for scripting, as it is very easy and quick to write small and useful utilities.

        I learned it mainly from reading the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) of the language.

        I try to keep up with the latest featuresm such as:
          * Asyncronous programming with coroutines
          * Context managers
          * Decorators
          * Metaclasses
          * Generators
          * Assignment expressions
