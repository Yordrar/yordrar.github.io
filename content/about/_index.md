I'm Juan Antonio, a passionate graphics programmer with an interest in graphics, rendering and game engines.

I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in graphics, computation, AI, computer vision and data compression

I enjoy doing side projects to challenge myself and learn something new.
You can find all my personal projects either in my [Github page](https://github.com/yordrar) or my [portfolio](/portfolio).
