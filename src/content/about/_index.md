I'm Juan Antonio, a passionate graphics programmer with an interest in graphics, maths and game engines.

I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in computation, AI and computer vision.

I enjoy doing side projects relating to graphics and game development to challenge myself and learn new things.
You can find all my personal projects either at my [Github](https://github.com/yordrar) or my [portfolio](/portfolio).

Regarding my passions, I'm focused on learning deeply and staying up to date with:
* Graphics APIs, such as DirectX or Vulkan
* GPU architectures
* Ray tracing
* Shader techniques and optimization
* Rendering techniques
* Mesh and geometry processing and manipulation
* Rigidbody and fluid physics
* ECS (Entity-component systems)
* Game engine design and development

I'm also focusing on learning deeper maths than those I learned at university.
To do that I'm reading textbooks and watching the great courses available at [MIT OpenCourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

Although my passions are computer graphics and game engines, my other interests are wide.
I'm interested in many areas of computer science, such as operating systems, compilers, databases, networks, signal processing, AI, data compression, software architecture, hardware architecture and functional programming, although I'm not focused on learing deeply about them.

Outside of computer science I enjoy meeting friends, playing videogames and reading fantasy books.
