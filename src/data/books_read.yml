    - title: The C++ Programming Language
      edition: 4th
      author: Bjarne Stroustrup
      image: images/books_read/cplusplus_programming_language.jpg
      tags: ["cplusplus", "languages"]
      description: | 
        This book not also explains the features of the C++ langauge, but also explains its design decisions and enumerates many good practices.

        It is not the best book to learn C++ from scratch, but it is the best reference to have at hand or to learn about the more obscure features fo the language deeply.
    - title: The C Programming Language
      edition: 2nd
      author: Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie

      tags: ["c", "languages"]
      description: | 
        The C Bible, as some call it, is the best reference book of the C language.

        Although it is more a reference of the language than a tutorial, it is very well explained and it is possible to learn C from scratch using it.
    - title: Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software
      edition: 0
      author: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides
      image: images/books_read/design_patterns.jpg
      tags: ["software"]
      description: | 
        One of the most important and influential books of software engineering.

        The "Gang of Four", as they are called, describe in this book a series of patterns in object-oriented programming that solve common problems of software architecture.
        They also provide code implementing each pattern in the C++ language, making it a great learning resource and reference to check when programming.
    - title: Modern Operating Systems
      edition: 4th
      author: Andrew S. Tanenbaum

      description: | 
        The best book there is to step into the world of operating systems.

        Tanenbaum touches in this book all aspects of an operating system from a theoretical perspective, making it very easy to understand and grasp.
        I followed this book at a university course about the design and structure of operating systems.
        Since then I've been intrigued by the world of operating system design and implementation.
    - title: The Annotated Turing
      edition: 0
      author: Charles Petzold
      image: images/books_read/annotated_turing.jpg
      tags: ["computation"]
      description: | 
        A book that explains with great detail Turing's paper that revolutionized the world.

        In this book, Charles Petzold explains every paragraph of the original paper written by Turing in which he described his famous "computing machines".
        Before that, it also introduces you to a couple of mathematical concepts needed to understand Turing's proof of the halting problem and its relation to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.
        Prior knowledge to math is not needed to fully understand this book, as it explains every concept intuitively and with many examples.

        A great book to step into the world of computation.
    - title: Game Engine Black Book - Wolfenstein 3D
      edition: 2nd
      author: Fabien Sanglard

        An awesome book explaining how the engine of the classic game Wolfenstein 3D by Id Software was implemented.

        This book goes through every aspect of the game engine implemented by John Carmack to achieve the graphics and gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D.
        It explains the source code in great detail with many images and diagrams.
        It is a very pleasant read, and a very educational one as well to learn about graphics, as the Wolfenstein 3D engine worked exclusively with 2D ray casting.
        This was done to make it run smoothly on very limited hardware (Intel's 386 CPU at best).
    - title: Game Engine Black Book - Doom
      edition: 1st
      author: Fabien Sanglard
      image: images/books_read/gebb_doom.png
      tags: ["engines"]
      description: | 
        An awesome book explaining how the engine of the classic game Doom by Id Software was implemented.

        Similar to Sanglard's previous book, this one explains every detail of the graphics and game engine of Doom, with many diagrams, images, and source code examples.
        As with the previous one, this one is also a pleasant and educational, as Doom implements many advanced techniques to achieve better graphics than its predecessor because it could afford to run on newer hardware.
        In this book you can learn about BSP, ray casting, interpolation, perspective math and many more interesting and fundamental concepts of graphics.
    - title: The Little Book About OS Development
      edition: 0
      author: Erik Helin, Adam Renberg
      image: images/books_read/little_book_os.png
      tags: ["os"]
      description: | 
        A great book explaining in a practical and concrete way how to implement the foundations of an operating system.

        It includes many images and code samples along with a beautiful explanation of every step, from the boot process to userland.
    - title: Mastering Qt 5
      edition: 2nd
      author: Guillaume Lazar, Robin Penea
      image: images/books_read/mastering_qt.png
      tags: ["qt"]
      description: | 
        A great book to learn Qt 5 from scratch.

        This book explains very well the Qt framework and many os its widgets.
        It also explains how the buid system of Qt, qmake, works, and how to take advantage of it to customize the build pipeline.
        Of course, because Qt is a giant and evolving framework, many details and widgets are not explained, and the book may be obsolete when the next version of Qt comes out.
        However, until that happens, this is a great introduction to user interface programming with the Qt framework.
    - title: Quaternions for Computer Graphics
      edition: 0
      author: John Vince
      image: images/books_read/quaternions_cg.jpg
      tags: ["math", "graphics"]
      description: | 
        The best book to learn the math behind quaternions and their applications to rotations and orientations in computer graphics.

        It starts from the very basics (real numbers and the complex plane) and from there builds the quaternions and their relation to rotations and rotation matrices.
        Beautifully explained, it is also a great reference to have at hand to check from time to time.
