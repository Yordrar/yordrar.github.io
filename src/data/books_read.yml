      tags: ["c", "languages"]
      description: | 
        The C Bible, as some call it, is the best reference book of the C language.

        Although it is more a reference of the language than a tutorial, it is very well explained and it is possible to learn C from scratch using it.

      description: | 
        A book that explains with great detail Turing's paper that revolutionized the world.

        In this book, Charles Petzold explains every paragraph of the original paper written by Turing in which he described his famous "computing machines".
        Before that, it also introduces you to a couple of mathematical concepts needed to understand Turing's proof of the halting problem and its relation to Gödel's incompleteness theorem.
        Prior knowledge to math is not needed to fully understand this book, as it explains every concept intuitively and with many examples.

        A great book to step into the world of computation.

        An awesome book explaining how the engine of the classic game Wolfenstein 3D by Id Software was implemented.

        This book goes through every aspect of the game engine implemented by John Carmack to achieve the graphics and gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D.
        It explains the source code in great detail with many images and diagrams.
        It is a very pleasant read, and a very educational one as well to learn about graphics, as the Wolfenstein 3D engine worked exclusively with 2D ray casting.
        This was done to make it run smoothly on very limited hardware (Intel's 386 CPU at best).
    - title: Game Engine Black Book - Doom
      edition: 1st

      description: | 
        An awesome book explaining how the engine of the classic game Doom by Id Software was implemented.

        Similar to Sanglard's previous book, this one explains every detail of the graphics and game engine of Doom, with many diagrams, images, and source code examples.
        As with the previous one, this one is also a pleasant and educational, as Doom implements many advanced techniques to achieve better graphics than its predecessor because it could afford to run on newer hardware.
        In this book you can learn about BSP, ray casting, interpolation, perspective math and many more interesting and fundamental concepts of graphics.

      tags: ["qt"]
      description: | 
        A great book to learn Qt 5 from scratch.

        This book explains very well the Qt framework and many os its widgets.
        It also explains how the buid system of Qt, qmake, works, and how to take advantage of it to customize the build pipeline.
        Of course, because Qt is a giant and evolving framework, many details and widgets are not explained, and the book may be obsolete when the next version of Qt comes out.
        However, until that happens, this is a great introduction to user interface programming with the Qt framework.

      tags: ["math", "graphics"]
      description: | 
        The best book to learn the math behind quaternions and their applications to rotations and orientations in computer graphics.

        It starts from the very basics (real numbers and the complex plane) and from there builds the quaternions and their relation to rotations and rotation matrices.
        Beautifully explained, it is also a great reference to have at hand to check from time to time.
    - title: Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
      edition: 4th

      description: | 
        The best book to learn the basics of graphics and the math behind them.

        It starts from the very basics and progressively touches almos every single aspect of computer graphics, such as ray tracing, data structures, the rendering pipeline, shading models, sampling methods and curves.

        Not only that, it is also explained wonderfully, with a lot of diagrams and images that help visualize all of the concepts.
    - title: Real Time Rendering
      edition: 4th
      author: Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman, Angelo Pesce, Michał Iwanicki, and Sébastien Hillaire
      image: images/books_read/real_time_rendering.jpg
      tags: ["math", "graphics"]
      description: | 
        A thorough compendium of real time rendering concepts.

        Although this book starts from the very basics of graphics, I think it is enjoyed best with a bit of prior knowledge.

        It is a great complement to Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, as it explains concepts that weren't covered in that book, such as physically based shading, volumetric rendering, and pipeline optimization.

        Overall, a great and well explained book of several advanced and very useful rendering techniques.
