      <description>This is a simple demo showcasing the Marching Cubes algorithm.
It is a really neat algorithm for procedurally generating meshes, specially terrain. I plan to eventually make a simple terrain editor based on this algorithm generating the mesh via a compute shader.
The GUI was made with the Dear ImGui library, and it allows you to change the grid resolution and cube size, as well as toggling interpolation and changing the mesh color.</description>

      <title>Direct3D model viewer</title>

      <description>This is a simple OBJ model viewer I made with DirectX 11 and Dear ImGui with the purpose of learning both of them.
It can load an OBJ mesh file and visualize it. You can also move the camera around in a Blender-like fashion. It can also visualize the vertex normals, as well as showing the mesh in wireframe or solid mode.
It is still not finished though, I plan to add some other features such ass different visualization options and shaders.</description>
